### The importance

Our main question is regarding the relationship between outbreak and reduction over time.

We are concerned with all the various outbreaks of COVID-19 and the patterns of reduction of after such outbreaks.

Considering that COVID-19 is widespread and harms people's health, this is important because analyzing and understanding the reasons and patterns behinds these outbreaks can help protect people in the future.

Accordingly, we plan to record the data and analyze it, and we hope that we can aid the government and general population in making decisions going forward.

### Main questions we are seeking to answer

- Is there a relationship between specific parts of the world and COVID-19 deaths?

- When were the 3 days with the most new cases?

- After the first COVID-19 outbreak, when did the daily new cases start to reduce?

- Is the timing of COVID-19 outbreaks related to the seasons of the year?

- How is the time required to quell COVID-19 outbreaks different across the globe?

### The dataset we are using

We use the dataset named Covid-19 Global Dataset from kaggle, and here is the link: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephassaker/covid19-global-dataset>. Kaggle is an online community which allows users to find and publish data sets and allow scientists to explorer data, work with other data scientists to solve data science challenges. 

Our dataset was scraped by Joseph Assaker, an artificial intelligence engineer from Lebanon, on March 17, 2022 from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), a trusted live-tracker of coronavirus data through official government reports so our data is authoritative.

We want to do research on the relationships between COVID-19 outbreaks and both the seasons of the year and different parts of the world. This dataset include all the statistics we want, so it best fits our project.

The data was collected in an attempt to more easily monitor and predict future trends regarding COVID-19, both on a worldwide scale and within specific countries.

### Ethical questions and limitations 

Seeing that this is a global dataset, one of the major limitations is the accuracy of the dataset. With countries like North Korea who tend to not give out information about their country, how can we be sure that we have accurate information from them or any other country. Countries could potentially lower their count to show that it is safe instead of suffering major economic setbacks. 

Generalizing this dataset by describing it as “global” seems far-fetched due to the fact that many countries may not want to share their data. Additionally, this dataset doesn’t show the many external variables that create different results within different countries. Knowing these third party variables could further explain what is going on within the country. This also leads me
